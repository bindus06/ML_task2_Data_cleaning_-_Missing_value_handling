# ML_task2_Data_cleaning_-_Missing_value_handling
This project demonstrates practical data preprocessing skills by identifying, visualizing, and handling missing values in real-world datasets.

Steps performed : 
1. Loaded the dataset and identified missing values using `.isnull().sum()`
2. Visualized missing data patterns using bar charts
3. Applied median imputation for numerical features
4. Applied mode imputation for categorical features
5. Removed columns with extremely high missing values
6. Validated the dataset after cleaning
7. Compared dataset size and quality before and after preprocessing
